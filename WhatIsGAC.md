GAC-80K is a set of 80,000 propositions in plain english stored within a text file.  It was originally released in 2005 as a subset of the mindpixel data gathered betwenen 2000-2005.  The term "GAC" stands for _General Artificial Consciousness_.

The terms of use for GAC-80K specify that the data is only to be used for research or non-commercial uses, but since the original mindpixel project no longer exists this probably doesn't apply to contemporary users, unless some new ownership claim is forthcoming.

It is assumed that the original mindpixel database was lost or destroyed, after the death of its curator in 2006, but most of this data will have been of low quality or have consisted of unvalidated singular votes within the "long tail".  However, a new version of the GAC has been created containing a total of approximately 360K propositions.  This was achieved by converting ConceptNet entries and their scores from the [OpenMind project](http://www.openmind.org/) into the same text format as used by the original GAC-80K.

# mindpix

This project is a set of command line utilities written in Mono/C# for manipulating, visualising and querying the mindpixel data set, creating new data sets in the same format as the original GAC-80K, and measuring the performance of language capable artificial intelligence systems. Mindpixels may be stored as plain text or within a MySql database, and can also be exported in a variety of formats for use with other systems such as OpenCog.

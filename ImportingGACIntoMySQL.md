In order to initially create the database tables you may initially need to [add a test mindpixel](AddMindpixels.md), then [empty the tables](HowToCreateMySQLDatabase.md).

To import a text file containing mindpixels, use the mpcreate utility as follows:

```
    mpcreate.exe -load /usr/bin/mindpixels.txt
```

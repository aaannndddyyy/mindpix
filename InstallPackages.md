You can of course compile from source, with the Mono runtime and Monodevelop, but the easiest way to install is from pre-compiled packages.

Double click on the **deb** or **rpm** packages to install them, or within a terminal:

```
    sudo dpkg -i mpexport.deb
    sudo dpkg -i mpcreate.deb
    sudo dpkg -i mpmist.deb
```

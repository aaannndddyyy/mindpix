This project is a set of command line utilities written in [Mono/C#](http://www.mono-project.com) for manipulating, visualising and querying the mindpixel data set, creating new data sets in the same format as the original [GAC-80K](WhatIsGAC.md), and measuring the performance of language capable artificial intelligence systems.  Mindpixels may be stored as plain text or within a [MySql](http://www.mysql.com/) database, and can also be exported in a variety of formats for use with other systems such as [OpenCog](http://www.opencog.org/wiki/The_Open_Cognition_Project).

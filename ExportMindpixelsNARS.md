Mindpixels can be exported in a format suitable for reading into [NARS](http://nars.wang.googlepages.com/) as follows:

```
    mpexport.exe -mindpixels /usr/bin/minpixels.txt -nars nars.txt
```

This takes mindpixels stored within a text file, parses them, then saves them to a file called nars.txt.

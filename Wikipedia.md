Yes, and indeed the _mindpixels.txt_ file does contain some information mined from Wikipedia.  However, Wikipedia only contains half of the world's knowledge.  It contains information about what most humans believe to be true (or somewhat true), but it doesn't contain information about what the average person believes to be false.  If anyone were to make such entries on Wikipedia they would quickly be removed.  The original Mindpixel project explicitly attempted to capture information about what people belive to be false, such as:

```
    Are chairs edible?
    Is the moon made of cheese?
    Can the universe breakdance?
```

As various AI researchers have pointed out in the past, knowing what probably isn't true about the world is just as important as knowing what is.

**Encyclopedias don't cover everything**

The other problem is that encyclopedias only contain certain kinds of knowledge - what might commonly be refered to as "book smarts".  What encyclopedias don't contain is the very common things which we all know and take for granted, such as that cups are often found on tables and that the sky is always above the ground.  This knowledge comes from our shared embodied experience of the world, and it is at least in principle possible that such information could be acquired by a "child machine" inhabiting a simulated or robotic body.

To add new mindpixels use the **mpcreate** utility.  The syntax is as follows:


**-q**         Question with a yes or no answer, which should be surrounded by quotes.

**-a**         Answer "yes" or "no"

**-username**  User entering the mindpixel

**-password**  User password


Here's an example:

```
    mpcreate.exe -q "Has Elvis left the building?" -a yes -username testuser -password password
```

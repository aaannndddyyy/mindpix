## As a workaround for the limitations of NLP ##

Getting computers to understand ordinary written languages is a notoriously hard and still largely unsolved problem in artificial intelligence, known as Natural Language Processing (NLP).  So there's a gap between the sorts of things which most humans can describe and the very formalised languages which computers can understand.

So how can you move knowledge from the human world into the computer world?

Unambiguous human languages, such as [Lojban](http://www.lojban.org), have been proposed to bridge the gap, but for the average human learning to write (or speak) in Lojban is pretty hard and requires a significant investment of time and effort.

Computers are good at understanding things with a yes or no answer, because the fundamental unit of modern computers is the transistor which can have an on or off state.  It turns out that questions with a yes or no answer are significantly easier to parse than solving the full NLP problem, because they typically contain separators which are relatively easy to identify.  The other advantage of yes and no is that when many people vote one way or the other on a given question a coherence value can be calculated, similar to a probability.

If enough people vote and the database becomes large enough a sort of probabilistic map of human average psychology can be mapped out, including elaborate ontologies which in the past needed to be painstakingly crafted by experts versed in the black art of formal logic.

So something like mindpixel - a large set of yes or no questions upon which people vote - might be an interrim way of creating proto-AIs based upon human knowledge, prior to the natural language processing problem being decisively solved.

One criticism of the mindpixel approach is the lack of temporal associations.  So for instance the mindpixel _"Is George Bush the president of the US?"_ would have been mostly true in 2002, but mostly false in 2009.  A way to get around this is also to retain the user information along with timestamps for each mindpixel vote.  This would allow coherence values to be computed over different time spans, as the content of the collective conscious changes over time.  Analysing such temporal change would itself be an interesting project, if a sufficiently large data set were available.

There were also more advanced and speculative ideas associated with the original mindpixel project, such as the ability to _geometrically interpolate_ knowledge without the need for conventional reasoning, but such things are probably beyond the scope of this project.

## As a way of measuring humanness in artificial intelligences ##

_"There was a minimum intelligent signal, and it was just one bit."_

The classic intelligence test for AIs is the immitation game proposed by Turing.  Turing's test involves human players making judgements as to whether they are dealing with another human or a machine, but this is a relatively crude test which makes it difficult to determine the degree of human-like responses in the machine - unless a large number of players are involved.

An alternative to Turing's proposal which gives a more fine grained measure of humanness is the [Minimum Intelligent Signal Test (MIST)](MIST.md).  The mindpixel data can be used to carry out such tests, and provided that the machine has not cheated by obtaining direct access to the mindpixel data and assuming a sufficiently diverse set of mindpixels are available this should provide a fair method testing the machine.
